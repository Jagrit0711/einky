**einky** is a small project that lets you use a Raspberry Pi with an E-Ink display to show useful info like time, weather, calendar, or custom text and images.  
It’s simple, quiet, and looks like paper no glare, no distractions.

### What You Need
- Raspberry Pi (3, 4, or Zero 2 W)  
- MicroSD card (8GB or more)  
- Any supported E-Ink display (Inky or Waveshare)  
- Power supply and frame/stand
