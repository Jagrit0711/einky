## 11/3/2025 11:22 AM - Getting Started  

Started exploring the idea of einky today. I’ve been researching how e-paper displays work and what models are compatible with the Raspberry Pi. It’s crazy how low-power and crisp they look. I don’t have the hardware yet, but I’m setting up the codebase and understanding the libraries I’ll need once I do. Feels good to finally begin something that blends design and tech.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk2NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--883678fba3b4212515ede96ff5f5bb0a0445f8b4/image.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 11:23 AM - Hardware Research  

Spent the day diving into datasheets and setup guides for e-paper displays. I compared refresh rates, resolutions, and power usage. The tech behind these displays is actually more complex than I expected — the partial refresh thing is wild. I’m also mapping how the code interacts with GPIO pins so I’m ready when I get the parts.

 turning theory into a plan.  

## 11/3/2025 11:23 AM - Coding & Simulation  

Worked on the backend part today. Set up a simple local script to simulate what the e-paper output might look like. Tweaked fonts, spacing, and time formatting. Still no physical setup, but the logic side is shaping up nicely. Once the hardware arrives, I’ll just have to plug it in and test. For now, it feels good seeing the idea take form on screen.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2ee13d10c4bb77290db12f74bd8a7c2d23137136/image.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 10 PM - Cleanup & 3D Frame  

Spent the day fixing up the project after realizing it needed a serious cleanup. I went through the README and removed every bit of AI like text now it actually sounds like me, not a robot. Also started working on a custom 3D frame for the setup instead of a PCB. The idea is to give einky a proper structure that looks neat and fits the components perfectly. ![Screenshot 2025-11-01 102011](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODEwMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1534249597ed918cba612f3424c407034d640355/Screenshot%202025-11-01%20102011.png)
