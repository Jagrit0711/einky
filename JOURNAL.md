## 11/3/2025 11:22 AM - Getting Started  

Started exploring the idea of einky today. I’ve been researching how e-paper displays work and what models are compatible with the Raspberry Pi. It’s crazy how low-power and crisp they look. I don’t have the hardware yet, but I’m setting up the codebase and understanding the libraries I’ll need once I do. Feels good to finally begin something that blends design and tech.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk2NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--883678fba3b4212515ede96ff5f5bb0a0445f8b4/image.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 11:23 AM - Hardware Research  

Spent the day diving into datasheets and setup guides for e-paper displays. I compared refresh rates, resolutions, and power usage. The tech behind these displays is actually more complex than I expected — the partial refresh thing is wild. I’m also mapping how the code interacts with GPIO pins so I’m ready when I get the parts. Slowly![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk2NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b2980a216829d14f6f9c7884441a256755d2b621/image.png)
 turning theory into a plan.  

## 11/3/2025 11:23 AM - Coding & Simulation  

Worked on the backend part today. Set up a simple local script to simulate what the e-paper output might look like. Tweaked fonts, spacing, and time formatting. Still no physical setup, but the logic side is shaping up nicely. Once the hardware arrives, I’ll just have to plug it in and test. For now, it feels good seeing the idea take form on screen.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2ee13d10c4bb77290db12f74bd8a7c2d23137136/image.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 10 PM - Cleanup & 3D Frame  

Spent the day fixing up the project after realizing it needed a serious cleanup. I went through the README and removed every bit of AI like text now it actually sounds like me, not a robot. Also started working on a custom 3D frame for the setup instead of a PCB. The idea is to give einky a proper structure that looks neat and fits the components perfectly. ![Screenshot 2025-11-01 102011](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODEwMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1534249597ed918cba612f3424c407034d640355/Screenshot%202025-11-01%20102011.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 11 PM - Fixing the BOM & Switching to Pi 3  

Got feedback about using a Raspberry Pi Zero W to cut costs, but after testing and thinking it through, I decided to switch to a Raspberry Pi 3 instead. The Zero would make the experience super laggy and limit what I can add later. Since I plan to bring in more hardware-based features soon, sticking with a more modular setup makes way more sense. I updated the BOM accordingly and sent new cart screenshots to keep everything consistent. The Pi 3 feels like the right balance between performance and flexibilityit’ll keep the project smooth and ready for future upgrades ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODEyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--11a4c8f2f6340e7e139012c3bb5d3d4ecd40a733/image.png)
  

## 11/4/2025 1 AM - here are sketches   

Hey! Here are the sketches of my CAD model as requested. I’m not adding the 3D models of the electronic components since the case was originally made for a school project, and the physical one was taken back as it belonged to the school. I actually designed it last week, so it still comes under the project’s start date. The frame was made for a Raspberry Pi 4, so it might look slightly off, but I’ve already left a bigger cutout for the I/O ports, so even a full-sized HDMI fits perfectly instead of a micro one.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--655034541301118247fb61bd99c9e5dc00032946/image.png)

## 11/4/2025 9 AM - Adding Temperature Sensor and Upgrading Hardware  

After the review, I got to know my project didn’t have enough hardware complexity to qualify for Tier 2. So I decided to add a temperature sensor to make it more interactive and useful. It’ll show live room temperature and automatically update on the e-ink display.

Since I’m now adding sensors, I’ve already switched from the Pi 4 to a Pi 3, because the Zero is way less modular and would struggle to handle multiple components. The Pi 3 gives me more GPIO access and makes future hardware upgrades easier.

We’ve already developed the software to integrate the new sensors, and the case design already has enough space to fit them in neatly. I’ve also updated the BOM, which now makes the build more complete and hardware rich.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI1MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5cc740aa123917ec8d6f0707518559cfea8e2d6c/image.png)

## 11/4/2025 10 AM - sketches!  

Hey! As requested, here are the sketches of my CAD design, and I’ve also updated them on GitHub. These were made inside FreeCAD using 2D projections of my 3D case model. Please review and let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to add or modify. Thanks!

## 11/5/2025 - Increasing Hardware Complexity & Next Steps  

Today I upgraded the project’s hardware setup to make it more complex and feature-rich. I’ve already added three different sensors temperature, motion, and light and the system is running successfully in simulation. The next planned upgrade is adding a microphone module so the display can respond to voice input and move toward a “smart display” experience.

I also updated the BOM and code to support the new components. Once the full hardware is assembled, I’ll focus on polishing the design, UI, and overall presentation. The project is fully original there’s no existing build like this online, and people around me have already started getting inspired and trying to replicate it.

Next step: finalize the hardware build and start physical testing.
