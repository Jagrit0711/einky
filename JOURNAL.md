## 11/3/2025 - Getting Started  

Started exploring the idea of einky today. I’ve been researching how e-paper displays work and what models are compatible with the Raspberry Pi. It’s crazy how low-power and crisp they look. I don’t have the hardware yet, but I’m setting up the codebase and understanding the libraries I’ll need once I do. Feels good to finally begin something that blends design and tech.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk2NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--883678fba3b4212515ede96ff5f5bb0a0445f8b4/image.png)
